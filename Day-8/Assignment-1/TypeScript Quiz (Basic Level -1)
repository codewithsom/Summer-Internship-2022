# TypeScripyt Quiz (Basic Level-1) 

## Theory -

### 1. What are the basic datatypes in TypeScript ?

   - **Boolean**: These work the same way as they do in JavaScript. Variables of data type boolean are declared like:

     ```ts
     const myBool: boolean = false;
     ```

   - **String**: Same as strings in JavaScript.

     ```ts
     let myStr: string = "Hamburger";
     ```

   - **Number**: They are also the same as numbers in JS.
     ```ts
     const minAgeToVote: number = 18;
     ```
   - **Array**: Arrays in TS are just like arrays in js.
     ```ts
     const myArr: number[] = [12, 90, 71];
     ```
     The above example is suitable for cases when the entire array will only store numbers.
     You can also declare an array in the below method:
     ```ts
     const myArr: Array<number> = [12, 90, 71];
     ```
     To create an array that can store all the datatypes:
     ```ts
     const myArr: Array<any> = [12, "true", false];
     ```
   - **Tuples**: Tuples are a data type unique to TypeScript. You can consider them as arrays with fixed elements. This is a great alternative when you know how many variables do you want in your array.

     ```ts
     let mine: [number, string];
     mine[0] = 14; // This is accepted.

     mine[0] = "Hello"; // This will throw an error.

     mine = [121, "Dave", "Ardito"]; // This also throws an error.

     mine = [12, "Diablo"]; // This works.
     ```
