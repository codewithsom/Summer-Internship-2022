# JavaScript Quiz (Basic Level-2)

### Theory -

### 1. Why do we use functions in JavaScript ?

 * Functions are essentially re-usable blocks of code.
   * Say we would be needing to square a number multiple times in our code. We may write the logic of squaring a number multiple times but that would just make our code unnecessarily lengthy.
   * Instead, we can just create a function once which defines the logic of squaring a number and use that function multiple times.
