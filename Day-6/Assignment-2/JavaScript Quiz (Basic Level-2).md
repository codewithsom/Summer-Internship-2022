### 1. Why do we use functions in JavaScript ?

* JavaScript Functions : 
  * JavaScript provides functions similar to most of the scripting and programming languages. In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want. A JavaScript function can be defined using function keyword.

### 2. What is Function Invocation?

* A Function is Invoked when it's name is written with a parenthesis "()" written in front of it. 
   * Example :-
   ```js
   function test() {
       console.log("Hello Everyone!")
   }
   
   test() // Function is invoked. Output - "Hello Everyone!"
   ```
