# JavaScript Quiz (Basic Level-2)

### Theory -

### 1. Why do we use functions in JavaScript ?

* JavaScript Functions : 
  * JavaScript provides functions similar to most of the scripting and programming languages. In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want. A JavaScript function can be defined using function keyword.

### 2. What is Function Invocation?

* The code inside a function is not executed when the function is defined. The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked. It is common to use the term "call a function" instead of "invoke a function". It is also common to say "call upon a function", "start a function", or "execute a function".
   * For Example :-
   ```js
   function test() {
       console.log("Hello Everyone!")
   }
   
   test() // Function is invoked. Output - "Hello Everyone!"
   ```
