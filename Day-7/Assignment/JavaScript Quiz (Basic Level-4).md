### 1. What are anonymous functions in JavaScript ?

* Anonymous Function is a function that does not have any name associated with it. Normally we use the function keyword before the function name to define a function in JavaScript, however, in anonymous functions in JavaScript, we use only the function keyword without the function name.
 * For Example :
 ```js
 <script>
var greet = function () {
	console.log("Welcome to CodeWithSom ðŸ˜Ž");
};

greet();
</script>

Output : Welcome to CodeWithSom ðŸ˜Ž
```
